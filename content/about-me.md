# About Me

##  I'm a **Front End Developer** / **Graphic Designer** and I love to make sites that are *cool*, *fast* and *accessible*.

I started working with web design in 2009/2010, but my interest in the web and development goes before that, when I was designing my layouts for my MySpace profile and my Tumblr page (unfortunately these pages have been lost to time), that's when I discovered the magic of design and the possibilities of web development and then I decided to study graphic design and web development.

While attending design college I got into my first job as a trainee for the front-end team on a publicity agency, under an awesome team that oriented me on the value of accessibility and responsive design, later on, I worked on a software development house where I learned all I know today about software architecture. This background enlightened me on the value of writing code that is clean and readable, looking to facilitate teamwork and keep everything easy for people working with me or for my future colleagues that will inherit my code.

As of today I'm working as a UI Developer, helping the design team wit complex and challenges, to build and keep a style and UI guidelines on the projects, creating wireframes and coding the front-end of the design, making a bridge between the design and development teams.

With my two assistants always reviewing my code, I can keep it the best possible (but sometimes they sleep on the job).

Technologies that I work with:
- Javascript / Typescript
- Vue
- React
- React Native
- Angular
- Ember.js
