# About Me

##  I'm a **Front End Developer** / **Graphic Designer** and I love to make sites that are *cool*, *fast*, *interactive*, and *accessible*.

I've started working with web design on 2010, but the interest in the web and development goes before that, when I was designing layouts for my MySpace profile and tumblr page (unfortunately these pages have been lost to time), but that's when I discovered the magic of design and the possibilities of web development, so I decided to study graphic design.

In my first job I was a trainee on a publicity agency, under an awesome team that taught to me the value of accessibility and responsive design, later on i've worked on a software development house where I learned all I know today about software architecture.

Technologies that I've worked with:
- Javascript / Typescript
- Vue
- React
- React Native
- Angular
- Ember.js
